# jailbreak-game
2D RPG in development.  

Developed by Anthony Cittadino.  

This is my first game, it is being created in Unity.

All assets (textures, sounds, music) will all be created by me (with the exception of some player and character sprites, because I suck at animating).

Feel free to use these assets for your own projects as long as you let me know.
